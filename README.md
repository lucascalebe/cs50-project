My CS50 final project is a webpage made for donating and adopting dogs and cats,
where each user makes his own registration and then can see on the main page all the animals available for adoption.
On each pet post has a button for adoption where you can click and get the data of the pet owner.
Also there's a page where you can fill out a form to donate a pet.
And the last page was made so that the user can see all his posts already made, and even delete.
For the construction of this website I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Python Flask and SQL.
